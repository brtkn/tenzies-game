### About this project

#### This is the final React project of the Scrimba React course from Bob Ziroll. I added some extra credits like roll counts and game timer to the project.

#### It was a nÄ±ce project to strengthen my React hooks knowledge. Like useState() and useEffect().

#### And I used conditional rendering and array methods to render components in necessary places.
